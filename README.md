# Yelp Restaurant Market Analysis  
Using SQL-driven insights to identify ideal locations and opportunities for a new restaurant venture.

---

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Yelp public dataset using SQL to uncover data-driven opportunities for launching a new restaurant concept. Our objective is to understand **which cities, categories, and market conditions offer the strongest potential for visibility, differentiation, and long-term growth**.

Through analyzing restaurant diversity, review activity, customer engagement patterns, and category performance, we aim to provide strategic recommendations for market entry.

## Project Goal  
To determine **the best city and restaurant category** for opening a new restaurant by:

- Identifying cities with **high restaurant diversity** and **active customer review engagement**
- Detecting restaurant categories that have **high competition but low average rating**, signaling opportunities for improvement
- Understanding customer satisfaction patterns and unmet needs through aggregated Yelp review data
- Recommending where a new concept could stand out while benefiting from existing demand

## Key Insights from SQL Analysis  

### 1. City-Level Market Opportunities  
- Cities with **high restaurant diversity** tend to have a more dynamic and open food culture.  
- Cities with **large and active review volumes** demonstrate strong customer engagement and higher discovery potential.  
- These markets are especially promising for new entrants seeking visibility.

### 2. Category Performance & Opportunity Gaps  
- Categories with **many existing restaurants but lower average ratings** signal areas where customers are underserved.  
- Popular segments like **casual dining** or **fast food** show a mix of high demand but inconsistent satisfaction.  
- These represent strong opportunities for **differentiation through quality**, without needing to create an unfamiliar category.

### 3. Strategic Opportunity Summary  
Our findings suggest the highest potential lies in:  
- Entering **diverse, review-active cities** with strong customer engagement  
- Targeting **popular but underperforming categories**, where improving quality can create immediate competitive advantage

## Final Recommendation  
Based on the analysis, we plan to explore opening a new restaurant in a **city with strong restaurant diversity and high review activity**, ensuring both demand and visibility.  
We will focus on **improving underperforming but highly popular categories**, such as casual dining or fast food, where customer dissatisfaction represents an opportunity for differentiation.

This strategy places us in an active, opportunity-rich environment while addressing clear gaps in customer experience.
