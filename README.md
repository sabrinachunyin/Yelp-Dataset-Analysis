# Yelp-Dataset-Analysis
A data exploration project analyzing business, review, and user trends from the Yelp Open Dataset.

## Overview
This project explores Yelp’s business and review ecosystem using Python-based data analysis. The goal is to understand:

- What makes a business highly rated  
- How review characteristics influence reputation  
- City & category differences  
- User behavior patterns (elite users, review volume, sentiment)

The analysis includes EDA, visualizations, data cleaning, and insights to support business and marketing decision-making.
